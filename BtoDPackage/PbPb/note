do project*.C first, then bFeedDownFraction.C
for MB, do invariant mass fit for each D0 DCA bin, then use the fit signal yield to do the 2 component fit.
for triggered, use side band, due to limitted statistics.
Thus for > 20 GeV/c, the *invMassFit.pdf plots are not really used.
Final results in bFeedDownResult.root
