Run fitting method

cd fitExtract 
./copyAndRun.sh 0 pp HF

1st argement = 0~4 correspond to 5 different variables, alpha, pt, rapidity, chi, decay length
2nd argument can be either pp or PbPb
3rd argument can be either HF or MB corresponding to using either high pt(triggered sample) or low pt(MB sample)
output plots will be in FitsVariables_ppHF and OutPuts_ppHF (or _ppMB, _PbPbHF, _PbPbMB postfix)

What copyAndRun.sh do?:
It just copy all relevent files and newly creat a folder named "test0ppHF" 
then execute doAnalysisVariable.sh in that folder and copy back output plots.


Run sideband method

just run MCDataComparisonFill.C
